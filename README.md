# NBA-Playoffs-Logistic-Regression

In this project for my Regression and Multivariate Data Analysis class, I was tasked with coming up with a topic and finding data in order to perform a logistic regression using the knowledge we gained in class. I chose to run a logistic regression using team data from the 2021-2022 NBA season, with the response variable being whether or not a team made the NBA playoffs that year and the predictor variables being various team defensive statistics including steals per 100 possessions, blocks per 100 possessions, defensive rebounding percentage, and opponent free throw attempts per field goal attempted. After fine tuning the model's features and removing unusual observations, I validated the model using team data from the 2018-2019 NBA season and achieved a correct classification of 80% of teams. The software I used was Minitab.
